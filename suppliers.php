				<p>Though we strive to source fruit from the Baltimore area as frequently as possible, we must face the facts of the fruit industry:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A lot of fruit isn't grown around here. Bananas and kiwis don't really enjoy this climate.</li>
					<li>Though we humans need vitamins year round, local harvest is only for a few months each season.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So when it's snowing locally, we reach out to our contacts around the country -- and sometimes the globe!</p>
				<p>It is our priority to find the perfect balance of local, and imported fruits to ensure you get the freshest, most delicious fruits available <i>anywhere</i>, we're no longer limited by just what's nearby.</p>
